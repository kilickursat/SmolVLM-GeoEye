# VLM Integration Fixes for SmolVLM-GeoEye

This pull request fixes the three main disconnections in the app:

## ðŸ”§ Changes Made

### 1. **Connected AI Chat to Uploaded Documents**
- Modified `GeotechnicalMultiAgentOrchestrator.route_geotechnical_query()` to extract and use document content
- AI agents now analyze based on VLM-extracted content and numerical data from uploaded documents
- Added context-aware queries that include document content and extracted numerical values

### 2. **Enhanced Numerical Data Extraction**
- Created `GeotechnicalDataExtractor` class with `extract_numerical_data_from_text()` method
- Extracts actual numerical values with units from VLM responses using enhanced regex patterns
- Supports extraction of SPT values, bearing capacity, density, moisture content, depths, etc.
- Stores numerical data separately in structured format for easy access

### 3. **Fixed Visualizations to Use Numerical Data**
- Updated `GeotechnicalVisualizationModule` to create visualizations from extracted numerical data
- Added `_create_numerical_visualization()` method for proper data plotting
- Creates appropriate charts: SPT vs depth profiles, bearing capacity bars, soil property distributions
- Falls back gracefully when no numerical data is available

## ðŸ“Š Key Improvements

- **Document-Based Q&A**: AI assistant now answers questions based on uploaded document content
- **Numerical Analysis**: Properly extracts and displays numerical values with units and context
- **Smart Visualizations**: Creates meaningful charts from extracted numerical data instead of keyword counts
- **Enhanced VLM Query**: Improved prompt to request numerical values with units

## ðŸ§ª Testing

To test the fixes:
1. Upload a geotechnical document (PDF, image, or CSV)
2. Ask questions about the content - AI will answer based on extracted data
3. Check Data Analysis tab to see extracted numerical values
4. View Visualizations tab to see proper charts of numerical data

## ðŸ’¡ Example Queries
- "What are the SPT values in the uploaded document?"
- "Summarize the soil properties from the test results"
- "What is the bearing capacity mentioned in the report?"
- "Analyze the soil test data and provide recommendations"

These fixes ensure the app properly leverages SmolVLM's superior OCR capabilities for extracting and analyzing geotechnical data!
